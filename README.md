# pyroot

###function roots

I would like to add sample solvers for all of the root finding methods.  If you know of another method, please let me know.

It's in Python because it's easier to read than pseudocode.  Plus, it has the benefit of being executable.  So, this makes it easy for experimentation.

I don't use Numpy or Scipy because I'm not just trying to find one answer.  The intention is to be able to compare the various algorithms.
